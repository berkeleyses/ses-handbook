As an Engineering Physics (EP) major, you can pick from a range of focuses – an engineering mindset with a fundamental background. You might be interested in semiconductors, but you would study more solid state physics than most electrical engineers. Or, you want to build things, but still work though Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods of classical mechanics. Engineering Physics starts you off with more of a first-principles approach! If you’re curious about the foundations of technology, these extra physics classes help quench that thirst.

Chief among the attractions of Engineering Physics is the ability to take diverse classes. Go wild! Still, it helps to emphasize a particular area of study. Choose your curriculum according to your interests at the time. If you keep thinking about how materials work, take E 45. If you are finding an interest in theory, try programming – a useful tool to run simulations. (Lecturer Reinsch in the physics department advocates that all physics undergraduates learn to program!)

That said, make sure to know what the prerequisites are for a class and read the fine print in the General Catalog ({\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont guide.berkeley.edu}). That way, you can take your requirements before taking upper-division classes. Since some classes are offered in only the Fall or Spring semester, missing a prerequisite can become a hassle. Key survey classes that are important prerequisites for many interesting upper-division classes are E 45 (for Material Science classes), EE 16A/B (for Electrical Engineering classes), and ME C85/CEE C30 (for Civil and Mechanical Engineering classes).

Some of the required classes have a list of recommended – but not strictly required – classes. Ask the professor (and definitely ask students who have taken the class) if the prerequisite is actually necessary. Many students agree that you will be best off if you use Advanced Placement credit to pass out of Math 1A/B and Chem 1A/1AL. This should give you more time for the really interesting and important upper-division classes. It could also help make your semester unit loads more bearable. Use the time to develop relationships with your peers in physics – many will take a few upper-division classes with you. We strongly encourage taking the Physics 5 series. The Physics 5 series is designed for Physics majors and the added rigor and challenge will help you adjust to upper-division physics and mathematics courses more easily. Most Physics majors take the 5 series, so that is where you can best meet the students that will be in your upper division classes. \textbf{Take the time to form study groups in your physics and engineering classes! Most of the learning in these classes happens by working together on problem sets}

In your first year, it is fairly standard to focus on lower-division physics, math, chemistry, and miscellaneous breadths. You can make important decisions (such as what topic to focus on) in your sophomore year, so don't stress out just yet! If you do have open slots, be sure to explore intro classes, such as Astro 7A, CS 61A, EE 16A/B, or Math 55. These classes can help you decide your interests so you can plan out your courses over the next four years.

\textbf{Depending on how you use your electives, this major is well-suited for graduate studies in physics, engineering, and materials science. Graduates regularly go to the best graduate departments in all of these areas.} You will notice that your degree requirements allow you to choose either an engineering course or the equivalent physics course for a broad range of subjects. If your goal is physics graduate school, it is recommended that you take Physics 105 (Mechanics), 112 (Thermodynamics), 137A/B (Quantum Mechanics), and 110A/B (Electrodynamics) in order to be prepared for graduate studies. On the other hand, if your goal is to enter a specific industry (say, for instance, aerospace engineering), then choose engineering courses related to your future career path. \textbf{Working in a research group and at an internship are both enlightening experiences; if you can, try both.}

For the lab courses, Physics 111 is the most useful for basic engineering and physics research – it equips you to understand experimental technique and instrumentation, which is ubiquitous. EE 143 is also very useful (and is recommended by Professor Attwood), especially if you are interested in semiconductors and fabrication techniques. Both of these classes can help to make you a great undergraduate researcher.

For math electives, you have a choice between the 121 series and 104/185. In general, students are split on which ones to take. We'll try and distill the pros and cons here, but a great way to decide is to talk to Engineering Physics majors that have already taken them! The 104/185 sequence can be difficult and time-consuming, which may impact your understanding and performance in other classes. However, they more adequately prepare you for graduate school in a theoretical field such as physics. Many students appreciate the logical clarity of Math 104 and that it demystifies ``rigorous" math. Math 185 (Complex Analysis) is applied in quantum mechanics, E\&M, and signal processing. None of the results in 104/185 are actually applied to any of these areas. If you want to know how to apply them, that is where the 121 series comes in.  It prepares you for math you’ll see in upper-division physics courses (special functions, solving different differential equations, and Fourier math). Also, more of your peers will be in the 121 series, so you’ll have a good study group and a more familiar curve. The tradeoff is that it is less cohesive and rigorous, and it is not really indicative of what upper division math is like. Additionally, if you plan on taking many upper-division physics courses, consider taking Physics 89, a mathematics course targeted at physics majors.

After you finish your lower-division courses, there are a lot of opinions about which physics upper-division courses you should take first. You’ll find that every course in upper-division physics is slightly related to all of the other upper-division physics courses. Some people say Physics 105 (Mechanics) is quite fundamental, but it’s very time-consuming, so you might consider saving it for your last year. Others say you should take it early on since it has a large overlap with lower-division material. While Physics 137A/B (quantum mechanics) are listed as pre-requisites for Physics 141A (solid-state physics), Physics 112 (Thermal Physics) is also incredibly useful. Physics 112 in particular can be very difficult or relatively easy depending on the professor. 

Many students end up taking mostly physics courses, and fulfilling their engineering unit requirement through electives. However, there are a few engineering courses that EP majors tend to favor instead of their physics counterparts. EE118 (optical engineering) instead of Physics 110B (E\&M) and EE143 (Microfabrication Lab) instead of Physics 111A (Instrumentation Lab) are common choices. Even though EE 117/118 and Physics 110A/110B are lumped together in the degree, many people have petitioned successfully to satisfy that requirement with EE118 and Physics 110A. 

Because you will have to make choices between engineering and physics courses, it may be helpful to have student descriptions of classes in addition to the General Catalog. \textbf{All of the above advice is no substitute for getting many different students' opinions on these courses.} Don’t know anyone who’s taken that class? Ask SES! Remember that the engineering courses tend to hone your numerical-spatial problem-solving skills, while physics courses will demand critical thinking with more equations and almost no numbers.

\textbf{Remember to consult with your faculty adviser often, and talk about potential plans for graduate studies. Your advisers are on your side – make sure to take advantage of the guidance they can provide!}
